    2015 Guidelines </h2>

    <div class="gdlinebox">
            The goal of the dynamic domain (DD) track is to support research in dynamic, exploratory search of complex information domains.  DD systems receive relevance feedback as they explore a space of subtopics within the collection in order to satisfy a user's information need.

            <h4><a name="participation">1. Participation in TREC</a></h4>
            <div class="gd_details">
            In order to take part in the DD track, you need to be a registered participant of TREC.  The TREC Call for Participation, at <a href="http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/call2015.html">http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/call2015.html</a>, includes instructions on how to register.  You must register before May 1, 2015 in order to participate.<br/><br/>

    The datasets and relevance judgments will be made generally available to non-participants after the TREC 2015 cycle, in February 2016.  So register to participate if you want early access.<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <h4><a name="domains">2. Domains and datasets for 2015</a></h4>
            <div class="gd_details">
            For 2015 there are four domains, each with different data:<br/><br/>

    <span class="bold">Illicit Goods:</span> this data is related to how illicit and counterfeit goods such as fake viagra are made, advertised, and sold on the Internet.  The dataset comprises posts from underground hacking forums, arranged into threads.<br/><br/>

    <span class="bold">Ebola:</span> this data is related to the Ebola outbreak in Africa in 2014-2015.  The dataset comprises tweets relating to the outbreak, web pages from sites hosted in the affected countries and designed to provide information to citizens and aid workers on the ground, and text files from West African and other government sources.<br/><br/>

    <span class="bold">Local Politics:</span> this data is related to regional politics in the Pacific Northwest and the small-town politicians and personalities that work it.  The dataset comprises web pages from the TREC 2014 KBA Stream Corpus.<br/><br/>

    <span class="bold">Polar Sciences:</span> this data comprises web pages, scientific data (HDF, NetCDF files, Grib files), zip files, PDFs, images and science code related to the polar sciences and available publicly from the NSF funded <a href="http://www.aonacadis.org"/>Advanced Cooperative Artic Data and Information System (ACADIS)</a>, NASA funded <a href="http://gcmd.nasa.gov/portals/amd/">Antarctic Master Directory (AMD)</a>, and National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) <a href="http://nsidc.org/acadis/search/">Arctic Data Explorer</a>.<br/><br/>

    All the datasets are formatted using the Common Crawl Architecture schema from the DARPA MEMEX project, and stored as sequences of CBOR objects.  See the <a href="dataset.html">datasets page</a> for more details.<br/><br/>

            </div>

            <h4><a name="topic">3. Topics </a></h4>
                <div class="gd_details">

              Within each domain, there will be 25-50 topics that represent user search needs. The topics are developed by the NIST assessors. A topic (which is like a query) contains a few words. It is the main search target for one complete run of dynamic search. Each topic contains multiple subtopics, each of which addresses one aspect of the topic. The NIST assessors have tried (very hard to) produce a complete set of subtopics for each topic, and so we will treat them as the complete set and use them in the interactions and evaluation. 

<!-- An example topic for the Ebola domain might be titled, "foreign aid health workers."  The topics will be developed by the NIST assessors.  Each topic will have a number of subtopic interests that make up the various pieces that the user wants to know.  Following the above example, subtopics might include "how many foreign health workers are in Freetown" and "what clinics are primarily staffed by foreign health workers".
-->
         <br/> <br/> 

         An example topic for the Illicit Goods domain could be found <a href="./resource/sample_topics.txt"> here</a>.  It is about "paying for amazon book reviews" and contains 2 subtopics.        
    

    <br/><br/>
   

         You can find the topics (with ground truth) from <a href="http://trec.nist.gov/act_part/tracks15.html"> TREC Active Participants Page </a> after you register for TREC Participation.        

                  

               </div>

            <h4><a name="task_description">4. Task Description</a></h4>
                <div class="gd_details">

    Your systems will receive an initial query for each topic, where the query is two to four words and additionally indicates the domain by a number 1, 2, 3 or 4.  In response to that query, systems may return up to five documents to the user.  The simulated user will respond by indicating which of the retrieved documents are relevant to their interests in the topic, and to which subtopic the document is relevant to.  Additionally, the simulated user will identify passages from the relevant documents and assign the passages to the subtopics with a graded relevance rating. The system may then return another five documents for more feedback.  Systems should stop when they believe they have covered all the user's subtopics sufficiently.  The subtopics are not known the system in advance; systems must discover the subtopics from the user's responses.<br/><br/>

    The following picture illustrates the task: <br/> <br/>

   </div>

     <h4> <a name="jig">5. User Simulator (Jig) and Feedback Format </a> </h4>
   <div class="gd_details">

    The system interactions with the user will be simulated using a jig that the track coordinators will provide to you.  This jigwill run on Linux.  The jig will include all relevance information for the task, but your system may only interact with this information through the jig.  <br/> <br/>

    The simulator (jig) package can be downloaded from <a href="http://trec-dd.org/resource/trec_dd.tar.gz">http://trec-dd.org/resource/trec_dd.tar.gz</a>.
  
    <br/> Here is the complete <a href="README.md.txt"> README </a> for the jig package. 


    <br/>     <br/> 


   The feedback that the jig provides each time to your system is in the following format:

  <pre>

Each feedback is a tuple of (subtopic_id, passage_id, rating, confidence) for a document: 

- docid: the id of a returned document
- subtopic_id: the id of a relevant subtopic that your returned document covers 
- passage_text: the content of a relevant passage that your returned document covers 
- rating: the relevance grade provided by NIST assessors. 1: marginally relevant, 2: relevant, 3: highly relevant, 4: key results. The relevance grades refer to the relevance level of your document to the whole topic. 


Note that subtopic_ids are global ids, i.e., a certain topic might contains subtopic with id 12, 45, 101, 103...
                
     Example feedback for topic 55 "Theresa Spence" for 5 search iterations :

                <div class="gd_details">
                The primary measures will be Cube Test, &#181;-ERR, and session NDCG.  Reference scripts will be provided by the track coordinators.  We will also likely report other diagnostic measures such as basic precision and recall.<br/><br/>

    The Cube Test is a search effectiveness measurement that measures the speed of gaining relevant information (could be documents or passages) in a dynamic search process. It measures the amount of relevant information a search system could gather for the entire search process with multiple runs of retrieval. A higher Cube Test score means a better DD system, which ranks relevant information (documents and/or psaasages) for a complex <a href="#topic">search topic</a>  as much as possible and as early as possible.

**************************************************************************
 
** The scorer used in TREC DD is cube test. score a submitted run using cubetest.pl

   Usage: perl ./scorer/cubeTest.pl qrel_file run_file cut_off
   
   - qrel: qrel file. It is a trec qrel file that converted from topics.xml. Its format is topic_id subtopic_id doc_no rating, which is located at ./truth_data/qrel.txt

   - run_file: Your run for submission.  It is in TREC format. 

  - cutoff: the number of iterations where you run cubetest over your results

   for example: perl scorer/cubeTest.pl truth_data/qrel.txt output/GU_RUN1 10

    &#181;-ERR is an extension to the cascade model of ERR by defining an outer loop in which the user changes the entity profile each time they find a useful piece of new information. <br/>
